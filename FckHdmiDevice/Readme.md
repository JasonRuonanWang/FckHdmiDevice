# 🔊 FckHdmiDevice
### *A hostile, unapologetic macOS weapon for exterminating useless audio devices.*

---

## 💀 What is this?

FckHdmiDevice is a microscopic macOS menu-bar app with one mission:

> **Erase every worthless, intrusive, fake, delusional, self-important audio device from your menu forever.**

No “UX enhancement.”
No “workflow optimization.”
No “experience improvement.”
**Just ruthless elimination.**
If a device shouldn’t exist, this app makes it **not exist**.

---

## ☠️ The Problem

macOS loves to shove trash into your audio list:

- HDMI pretending it's a premium speaker
- Displays magically claiming they support “audio output”
- Loopback devices breeding like mold
- Dongles with identity disorders
- DAW leftovers resurrecting themselves like undead parasites

Apple refuses to give you a “never show this again” button.

So this app gives you the nuclear alternative:

> **FCK OFF DEVICE — permanent disappearance.**

## 🔥 Features

  Native. Instant. Zero hacks.

- **One icon. Zero windows. Zero bullshit.**  
  A weapon, not an app.

## 🤬 Why this exists

Because HDMI audio is delusional.  
Because monitors claim to be speakers when everyone knows they are, in fact, shit.
Because virtual devices multiply like bacteria.  
Because macOS resurrects dead devices like a necromancer on drugs.  
Because your audio menu shouldn’t look like a toxic waste dump.

This app does **not** “switch faster.”  
It **purifies** your device list.

---

## 🧨 How to Use

1. Click the menu bar speaker icon  
2. See only devices that actually matter  
3. Send worthless entries to **Fck off device**  
4. Live in peace

If you need more instructions than this, you’re beyond saving.

Keep only what deserves to exist.  
Enjoy the silence of total control.
